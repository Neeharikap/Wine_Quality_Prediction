#  Wine quality prediction ML model in Spark over AWS
**Overview:** To build a wine quality prediction ML model in Spark over AWS which must
be trained in parallel using 4 EC2 instances.

### Project outcomes:
This project focuses on developing parallel machine learning (ML) applications in Amazon
AWS cloud platform. This includes: <br />
(1) Use of Apache Spark to train an ML model in parallel on multiple EC2 instances; <br />
(2) Using Sparkâ€™s MLlib to develop and use an ML model in the cloud; <br />
(3) Using Docker to create a container.<br />
<br />
### Project details:
(1) Input for model training: <br/>
    (a)  TrainingDataset.csv <br/>
    (b)  ValidationDataset.csv <br/>
<br/>
(2)  Input for prediction testing: TestDataset.csv <br/>
<br/>
(3) Output: Measure of the prediction performance, the F1 score. <br/>
<br/>
(4)Model Implementation: To develop a Spark application that uses MLlib to train for wine quality prediction using the TrainingDataset.csv. <br/>
<br/>
(5) Docker container: To store the images <br/>
